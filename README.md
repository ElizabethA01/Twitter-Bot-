# Twitter-Bot-

As part of my Udemy course 'Complete Software Developer: zero to mastery', I created a twitter bot that favourites tweets and follows people back.

# How to use 

You need to input your Twitter authentication access token to allow access to your twitter account. Next input the search_string of the keywords you would like the bot to look for the number of tweets it should favourite. To follow someone back, you need to input the names_string. 

# My Thoughts

I really enjoyed this project, because it was very practical and user friendly. Using the tweepy API made the process much easier to create a python code.
