## General Information
- The purpose of the Twitter bot is to follow and retweet tech content about coding to improve engagement and increase followings in the twitter account.  Space Invaders is a fixed shooter in which the player moves a laser cannon horizontally across the bottom of the screen and fires at aliens overhead.
- I undertook the project as part of a Udemy course 'Complete Software Developer: zero to mastery' and to follow similar tech content users. 


## Technologies Used
- Python - version 3.9


## Features
- Ability to follow and retweet.
- Utilised Tweety API to allow retweeting.

Room for improvement:
- Create tweets to improve engagement

To do:
- Improve code to include creating coding tweets. 


## My Thoughts
I really enjoyed this project, because it was very practical and user friendly. Using the tweepy API made the process much easier to create a python code.
